## Minimum Wage (Effective 1 January 2026)

| Year | Hourly Rate | Daily (8hr) | Fortnightly (80hr) | Monthly (approx) |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 2026 | K5.00 | K40.00 | K400.00 | ~K866 |
| 2027 | K5.25 | K42.00 | K420.00 | ~K910 |
| 2028 | K5.50 | K44.00 | K440.00 | ~K953 |

**Note:** This is the LEGAL MINIMUM. Industry average for security guards is approximately K4.91/hr (per PayScale data), but this was based on the old minimum. Market rates will adjust upward with the new minimum wage.

**Recommendation:** Budget guard wages at K5.00-K6.00/hr minimum to remain competitive and compliant.
