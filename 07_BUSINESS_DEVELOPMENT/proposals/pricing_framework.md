## 3. Pricing Strategy

### Markup Calculation

| Pricing Level | Markup | Billing Rate/Guard/Month | Margin |
|---------------|--------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Floor (break-even)** | 1.0x | K1,548 | 0% |
| **Minimum viable** | 1.3x | K2,012 | 23% |

| **Standard market** | 1.8x | K2,786 | 44% |
| **Premium** | 2.0x | K3,096 | 50% |

### Recommended Starting Rate

**K2,000-K2,500 per guard per month** (competitive entry pricing)

This positions Vanguard Elite Services as competitive against established companies while generating enough margin to cover costs and build reserves.

### Hourly Billing (Alternative)

If client prefers hourly billing:

| Guard wage | Total cost/hr | Billing rate (1.5x) | Billing rate (1.8x) |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| K5.00 | ~K7.50 | K11.25 | K13.50 |

**Recommended hourly rate: K10-K14 per guard per hour**

## 4. Contract Pricing Models

### Model A: Fixed Monthly Fee
- Agree a fixed monthly fee based on number of guards x rate
- Example: 10 guards x K2,200 = **K22,000/month**
- **Pro:** Predictable revenue; **Con:** Must manage overtime carefully

### Model B: Hourly Billing
- Bill actual hours worked per guard
- Example: 10 guards x 12hr shifts x 30 days = 3,600 hours x K12 = **K43,200/month**
- **Pro:** Covers all hours including overtime; **Con:** Client may resist open-ended billing

### Model C: Hybrid
- Fixed base fee for standard hours + hourly rate for additional/overtime
- **Pro:** Balance of predictability and flexibility

## 6. Forestry Contract Pricing Considerations

For remote forestry sites, factor in additional costs:

| Item | Additional Cost | Who Pays? |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Guard accommodation | K0 (client provides) | Negotiate in contract |
| Guard meals/rations | K300-K500/guard/month | Negotiate -- ideally client |
| Transport to/from site | K200-K500/rotation | Include in mobilization fee |
| Remote site allowance (guards) | K50-K100/guard/month | Add to guard wage |
| Rotation transport (ongoing) | K200-K500/month | Include in contract rate |

**Recommendation:** For forestry contract, propose that the client provides accommodation and meals (standard industry practice for remote sites). This significantly reduces your costs.

## 7. Revenue Projection (First Year)

### Scenario: 10 guards at K2,200/guard/month

| Month | Revenue | Cumulative |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 1 | K22,000 | K22,000 |
| 2 | K22,000 | K44,000 |
| 3 | K22,000 | K66,000 |
| 6 | K22,000 | K132,000 |
| 12 | K22,000 | K264,000 |

**Estimated annual profit (at 33% margin):** K87,120

This would provide sufficient capital to:
- Add Class B (armed) license in Year 2
- Purchase additional equipment
- Begin Canada expansion research
- Build financial reserves
