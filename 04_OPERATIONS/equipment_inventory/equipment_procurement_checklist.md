## Budget-Conscious Recommendations

1. **Start without radios** -- Use mobile phones initially. Add radios when revenue supports it.
2. **One uniform set initially** -- Issue 1 shirt + 1 trouser per guard, second set from first revenue.
3. **Skip hi-vis** -- Only buy if client/site requires it.
4. **Negotiate client contribution** -- For remote forestry sites, the client should provide shelter, water, and basic facilities. Include this in the contract.

**Lean equipment budget (MUST items only, no radios, 1 uniform set):** ~K2,500-K3,000
