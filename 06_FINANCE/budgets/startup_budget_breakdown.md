## CRITICAL FINDING: BUDGET GAP

**Best case:** K18,080 (barely fits in K20,000 with K1,920 buffer)
**Worst case:** K24,530 (exceeds budget by K4,530)

### Recommended Actions to Close the Gap

1. **Negotiate mobilization fee from forestry client** -- Request K5,000-K10,000 upfront payment to cover deployment costs. This is standard practice in the security industry for remote site contracts.

2. **Start with fewer guards** -- Deploy 6-8 guards initially instead of 10 to reduce first-month payroll by K1,700-K3,500.

3. **Negotiate 7-day payment terms** -- Get client to pay weekly or fortnightly rather than monthly to improve cash flow.

4. **Phase equipment purchases** -- Buy only essential items first (uniforms, torches), add rain gear and extras from first revenue.

5. **Negotiate insurance payment plan** -- Some insurers allow quarterly payments instead of annual lump sum.

## Revenue Projection (First Contract)

To understand break-even, we need to know the contract value. Typical security guard billing rates in PNG:

| Billing Model | Rate | Monthly Revenue (10 guards) |
|---------------|------|----------------------------|
| Per guard/hour (basic) | K8-K12/hr | K13,900-K20,900 |
| Per guard/month | K1,500-K2,500 | K15,000-K25,000 |
| Fixed monthly contract | Negotiated | Varies |

**Key metric:** You need to bill at MINIMUM 1.8x-2.2x the guard wage to cover all costs and generate profit.

**Minimum viable billing rate:** K10/hr per guard (K5 wage + K5 for overheads, insurance, profit)
