## Key Dependencies Identified

1. **SIA License BEFORE forestry contract can start** -- Cannot legally provide security services without it
2. **IPA Registration BEFORE SIA application** -- Must be a registered business entity first
3. **Budget allocation decision** -- Under K20,000 may not support all three service classes simultaneously
4. **Founder name required** -- For all registration documents

---

## Red Flags

1. **Budget vs. Scope Mismatch** -- All three service classes with under K20,000 is extremely tight. Class B (armed) alone requires firearms licensing, armory, and premium insurance.
2. **Verbal Agreement Risk** -- Forestry contract not formalized. Risk of scope creep, delayed payment terms, or loss of opportunity.
3. **No insurance in place** -- Cannot operate without appropriate coverage.
